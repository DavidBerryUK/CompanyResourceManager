# CompanyResourceManager

A sample project to explore usage of the following technologies:

## Technology
* .Net Core 2.2
* Entity Framework
* Fluent Assertions (https://fluentassertions.com/)
* Fluent Validation (https://fluentvalidation.net/)
* Rest Api (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
* Sql Server
* TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* Vue (https://vuejs.org/)
* Vuetify (https://vuetifyjs.com/)
* Jest (https://jestjs.io/)
* sass (https://sass-lang.com/)
* npm (https://www.npmjs.com/)
* nuget (https://www.nuget.org/)
* swagger (https://swagger.io/)

## Goals

The goal is to explore the building of a flexible, easily-maintainable system using components, free from the constraints of constant delivery deadlines. This enables code to be restructured and refactored to produce a better code base, something which is often not an option.

* Clean code
* Elegant UI and XD experience
* Simple Rest server side interface
* Component-based front-end
* Provide a template for future projects
* Shameless self-promotion
* Collaboration and knowledge sharing
