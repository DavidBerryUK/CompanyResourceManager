# CompanyResourceManager

A sample project to explore usage of the following technologies:

## Technology
* .Net Core
* Entity Framework
* Rest Api
* Sql Server
* TypeScript
* Vue
* Vuetify
* Jest
* sass

## Goals

The goal is to explore the building of a flexible, easily-maintainable system using components, free from the constraints of constant delivery deadlines. This enables code to be restructured and refactored to produce a better code base, something which is often not an option.

* Clean code
* Elegant UI and XD experience
* Simple Rest server side interface
* Component-based front-end
* Provide a template for future projects
* Shameless self-promotion
* Collaboration and knowledge sharing
